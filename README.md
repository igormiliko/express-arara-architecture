# ARARA Architecture ðŸ¦œ

### Hello everyone, I'm new in the express world and working hard with this technology just three months ago.

Thats project is an experimental architecture for applications wich use express under the hood. The concept is basic, is a REST architecture wich the ARARA will abstract the concepts of Routes, Controllers, Resolvers and create a new concept called `Middlefield`.

This repository is EXPERIMENTAL and open for helps, PAY ATTENTION:
   ## It's not a new FRAMEWORK ðŸ›‘

It's just a repo to aplly my knowledgements about back-end, performance, and OOP.

## Under the hood:

- [x] Nodejs
- [x] Express
- [x] Prisma
